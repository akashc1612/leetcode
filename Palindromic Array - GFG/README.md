# Palindromic Array
 Easy

Given a Integer array A[] of n elements. Your task is to complete the function PalinArray. Which will return 1 if all the elements of the Array are palindrome otherwise it will return 0.

 

Example:
Input:
2
5
111 222 333 444 555
3
121 131 20

Output:
1
0

Explanation:
For First test case.
n=5;
A[0] = 111    //which is a palindrome number.
A[1] = 222   //which is a palindrome number.
A[2] = 333   //which is a palindrome number.
A[3] = 444  //which is a palindrome number.
A[4] = 555  //which is a palindrome number.
As all numbers are palindrome so This will return 1.



Constraints:
1 <=T<= 50
1 <=n<= 20
1 <=A[]<= 10000
